microchord
###

Microchord is different. It's a [chorded keyboard][1] inspired by Engelbart's
[microwriter][2]. Unshackle yourself from the traditional typewriter keyboard.
Microchod is FOSS. It's extensible. It's cheap. It's designed for two-handed
programming or one-handed plaintext input.

I designed it for the programmer use case by dedicating one hand to letters and
the other hand to letters. There are modes for macros, and it runs on cheap and
easily available hardware. When I have them, I will make available designs for
3D-printing your own case for the microchord so you can build your own with a
3D printer and a [teensy 2.0][3].
